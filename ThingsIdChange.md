# Things I'd Change
- The styling of the front page seems barren without many habits.
- Allow you to click in the calendar to change a habit meta.
- Maybe allow you to pull up a list of habit meta?
- Change password.
- Styling of dark mode is rough. The baby blue color is harsh.
- Badges page scroll off edge issue. I think it's caused by the navbar fragment.
- Navbar title "Hello, ..." needs some buffer.
- Forgot password feature.
- Finish email feature. Needs formatting, and a page or button.
- Calendar styling. Today button is lower case??? Make it smaller on the page with some padding.
- dark mode stored in user preferences
