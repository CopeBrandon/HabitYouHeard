# Things I'd Change
- The styling of the front page seems barren without many habits.
- Allow you to click in the calendar to change a habit meta.
- Maybe allow you to pull up a list of habit meta?
- Change password.
- Badges page scroll off edge issue. I think it's caused by the navbar fragment. | fixed for all pages but YourProgress, imgs go off center when disableEqualOverflow="true"
- Navbar title "Hello, ..." needs some buffer.
- Forgot password feature.
- Finish email feature. Needs formatting, and a page or button.
- Calendar styling. Today button is lower case??? Make it smaller on the page with some padding.
- useEffect causes error when called before user is stated.
- Clamp width of tooltip on habit description if it gets too long. Maybe force a maximum size?
- Add page that is routed from the sign-in page that explains what this website is about.
- MIGHT add a dark mode toggle in the sign in/ sign up page that doesn't rely on user's token to work
- Add a sign up button
- update taskbar to contain all buttons on all pages, except for the page it is currently on
- responsive size for all components
- Consider removing second password in sign up.
