# Things I'd Change
- The styling of the front page seems barren without many habits.
- Allow you to click in the calendar to change a habit meta.
- Maybe allow you to pull up a list of habit meta?
- Change password.
- Badges page scroll off edge issue. I think it's caused by the navbar fragment. | fixed for all pages but YourProgress, imgs go off center when disableEqualOverflow="true"
- Navbar title "Hello, ..." needs some buffer.
- Forgot password feature.
- Finish email feature. Needs formatting, and a page or button.
- Calendar styling. Today button is lower case??? Make it smaller on the page with some padding.
- useEffect causes error when called before user is stated.
- Clamp width of tooltip on habit description if it gets too long. Maybe force a maximum size?
- Add page that is routed from the sign-in page that explains what this website is about.
- MIGHT add a dark mode toggle in the sign in/ sign up page that doesn't rely on user's token to work
- Update taskbar to contain all buttons on all pages, except for the page it is currently on.
- Responsive size for all components:
    - Size of description box minimum size?
    - Home and Habits page "habit" buttons
    - Appbar gets taller as aspect ratio decreases, might require javascript to calculate whenever viewport changes?
    - Possibly add a dropdown if aspect ratio decreases instead of the above.
- Consider removing second password in sign up.
- Rework getBadgeNameAndURL function to call an instance of an object that contains all data instead of using a series of arrays.
    - Basically, have a "Badge class" that contains the division, its colors, number, ranking in the division, and imgurl
- If previous habit-meta has no data and is from a past date, should be red.
- Display inactive habits with a toggle, and allow the user to reactivate or permanently disable them.
