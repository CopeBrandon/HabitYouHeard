Getting Started with HabitYouHeard

##Install

##Usage

This project is still in progress, so some of the instructions may not be functioning at this point in development!

Since IntelliJ uses the Gradle Wrapper, the easiest way to run the program is opening the Gradle tab, navigate to habityouheard -> Tasks -> application -> bootrun.

The API can then be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) via Postman or another tool to access endpoints. Specific endpoint routes can be found by inspecting the Controllers.
